# PipeCD Docs MCP Server

A local MCP server for searching official PipeCD docs.

## Overview

This server clones the official [PipeCD](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipecd) docs from GitHub and provides simple full-text search and document retrieval APIs via the MCP protocol.  
Documentation is cloned into a temporary directory, and Markdown files are indexed by extracting their titles and content.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Create a PAT with `read:packages` scope. [Details](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry)

2. Add the following config to your `.npmrc` file.

```npmrc
@pipe-cd:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN
```

      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

### search_docs

Executes a full-text search on PipeCD docs.

- Parameters:
  - `query`: Search keywords (space-separated, AND search)
  - `offset`: Start position for results
  - `limit`: Number of results to return (default: 20)

### read_docs

Returns the content of the specified page.

- Parameters:
  - `path`: Relative path of the document (after "docs/content/en/")

## Implementation Notes

- Uses sparse-checkout to minimize clone size and speed up the process.
- Titles are extracted from the Markdown front matter.
- The search logic of `search_docs` is so simple for now.
